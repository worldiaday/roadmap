# World IA Day roadmap
In this repository, you can find the official World IA Day organizational roadmap. Our organizational roadmap is where you can learn about what features, programs, and initiatives we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the discussion over on the [World IA Day community on Discord](https://www.worldiaday.org/discord) #future-of-wiad channel. 

The roadmap repository is for communicating World IA Day's roadmap. Existing issues are currently read-only, and we are locking conversations, as we get started. Weâ€™re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself. You'll notice that the original roadmap was on Airtable. As we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of World IA Day events and initiatives, if you have feedback about this roadmap itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through emailing info@worldiaday.org

## Guide to the roadmap
Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.
- A **committee** that indicates the area of the event/initiative to which the item belongs. For a list of current committee areas, see below.
- A **project/initiative** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below.

## Release phases
Every product or feature goes through a set of release phases, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha**: Primarily for testing and feedback
Limited availability, requires pilot agreement. Services still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for widespread use, and no documentation or support provided.

- **beta**: Publicly available in full or limited capacity
Services mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements usually published. No support provided.

- **ga**: Generally available to all WIAD
Ready for production use to all WIAD events and locations with associated and technical support obligations. 

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

- **in design**:
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to pursue this feature, but are still figuring out how.

- **exploring**:
Feature under consideration. We are considering pursuing this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Roadmap stages
The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the disclaimer below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline. You'll also find an Exploratory column, which is used in conjunction with the in design and exploring release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.
